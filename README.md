## Hacking on KBSecret

Want to hack on KBSecret? Here's how you can get started:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:kbsecret/kbsecret.git && cd kbsecret
$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
$ RUBYLIB=./lib PATH=./bin:${PATH} bundle exec ./bin/kbsecret help
```

### System Packages

You can also build (very experimental) installation packages:

```bash
$ bundle exec make deb # for apt/dpkg based systems
$ bundle exec make rpm # for yum/rpm based systems
$ bundle exec make pacman # for pacman based systems
$ ls pkg/{deb,rpm,pacman}/*
```

### Manual Pages

KBSecret's manual pages can be found online
[here](https://yossarian.net/docs/kbsecret-man/kbsecret.1).

If you'd like to generate the roff versions for `man(1)`, you'll need `ronn(1)`:

```bash
$ bundle exec make man
$ cp man/*.1 ${YOUR_MAN_DIR}
```

### Shell Completion

KBSecret provides shell completion functions for bash and zsh.

To generate the completions for Bash:

```bash
$ bundle exec make bash
$ # or, if you have additional commands that support --introspect-flags:
$ CMDS='foo bar baz' bundle exec make bash
$ cp completions/kbsecret.bash ${YOUR_COMPLETION_DIR}
```

To use the completions for zsh, add the completions directory to your $fpath or copy the \_kbsecret file to any of the directories in it.

Please feel free to contribute completion scripts for other shells!
